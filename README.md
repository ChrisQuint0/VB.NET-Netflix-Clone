# VB.NET-Netflix-Clone
I decided to learn the basics of VB.NET and one of the most effective ways to learn it is to make a project. I've always been fascinated by Netflix's user interface so I made a clone of Netflix, copying the platform's design and coding just the very basic functionalities giving the illusion that it works just like the real Netflix.
